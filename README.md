# Learning Git and GitHub


## Introduction
This is an introduction to GitHub course. We intend to take you through from creating a GitHub account to being able to collaborate using Git and GitHub. We will use resources that have been prepared by the lovely Git community, and made available under CC-BY license.

If you are using this curriculum to learn Git, we recommend you go through the materials sequentially. Nevertheless, if you have some experience, feel free to skip to the content of interest to you.

## Setting Up
To set up the Git command line, follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/). Additional instructions for setting up on a windows machine can be found [here](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/using-git-and-github-on-windows).
